# Semares bot

Implementation of a robot's algorithms for semantic map understanding and automatic reasoning by human-friendly knowledge description.
More details can be found at https://github.com/ant-nik/semares.

# Milestones

1. Depth estimation based on a stereo camera system (based on a vision system modeling in Webots simulation software + simple web camera pair tests).
2. Semantic 3D scene recognition based on open-set object detection models and SLAM frameworks (+ Webots simulation data).
3. Semantic reasoning process based on human input and Drools/durable rules/PDDL optimizer (+ Webots simulation data).
4. A Webots controller to make closed loop system.
5. A software set to control robot in Webots.
6. Field experiments with a system: stereo camera + smartphone and STM32 block as on-board controller + Notebook as processing unit.
